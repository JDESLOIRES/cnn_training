The objective of this repository is to understand step by step how to construct a Deep Neural Network (MLP, CNN) using lower-level APIs from Tensorflow2 :
- Define the models with class inheritance from tensorflow2 (model.py)
- Train the models by applying gradient descent and shuffling observations at each iteration (training.py)
- Visualize convolved and flatten layers (visualisation.py)
